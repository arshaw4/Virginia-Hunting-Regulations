About:
An android Kotlin app created based on a combinatoric problem to calculate the number of ways a Virginia Resident could limit out during various hunting seasons.
I came up with this idea after being assigned a project in combinatorics to think of an application of combinatorics to something relevant to your life,
so I thought I would apply it to hunting and take it as an oppurtunity to learn the Kotlin language and learn android app development.
The Report PDF is in the repo as Combinatorial Analysis of Virginia State Hunting Bag Limits.pdf
