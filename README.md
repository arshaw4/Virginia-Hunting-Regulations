About:
An android Kotlin app created based on a combinatoric problem to calculate the number of ways a Virginia Resident could limit out during various hunting seasons.
I came up with this idea after being assigned a project in combinatorics to think of an application of combinatorics to something relevant to your life,
so I thought I would apply it to hunting and take it as an oppurtunity to learn the Kotlin language and learn android app development.
